## Description: 

A site for planning gaming parties and tracking your gaming collection. As a console gamer I want to be able to see a comprehensive list of the games, consoles, and controllers that my friends have so that I can more easily plan what games a specific group of friends can play together

## Usage: 

Users will be able to log into their account. Once logged in they can go to their inventory or to plan a party. In inventory, they can manage their collection of games, consoles and controllers.
